# Project1
Create a Python app connecting to MySQL or MongoDB for a store system. It should handle CRUD operations with at least three tables/collections: Users, Products, and Orders. Users can register, log in, and view orders; admins can manage inventory, users, and view all orders. Include logging for database connections and interactions.
